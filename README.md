# File Explorer

About:
It's a file explorer, I...don't know how else to explain it.

Installation:
Download the project into a folder of your choosing. Thats it, that- that's the whole process. There's not much else I can say. I mean, it's not a complicated system. You just- you hit the download button, and you run the proj- the file explorer. Come to think of it, what could you possibly need a new file explorer, w-whats wrong with the one you have now? I-It's a file explorer, I mean you can't even- it's not like it's something you can uninstall from your phone, it's a- it's a native app. What are you doing here? I mean this isn't even a real file explorer. This is just a list of folders you'd see in a file explorer, but it looks like- it's formatted to look like a file explorer. You kno- you know what? I'm done explaining this. If you managed to delete your file explorer you're either smart enough to know how to download a new one or you're too stupid to deserve an explanation. I'm done.
